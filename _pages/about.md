I received my BA in Biology from Skidmore College, where I worked with Dr. David Domozych studying the green alga *Penium margaritaceum*. I recently defended my PhD dissertation on grapevine genetics and development in the Department of Plant Biology at Michigan State University and will be graduating in May 2024. In May 2024, I am starting a post-doc with Dr. Andrea Sweigart at the University of Georgia.

My passion for biology started out of an adoration for the natural world and has led me down various routes - from my first project monitoring a bat population in high school to my current work studying grapevine genetics and development, as well as genome and epigenome evolution in angiosperms.  In college, I became fascinated with plants and genetics, and I have never looked back!
