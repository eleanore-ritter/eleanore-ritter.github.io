I received my BA in Biology from Skidmore College in 2018, where I worked with Dr. David Domozych studying the green alga *Penium margaritaceum*. I recently defended my PhD dissertation on grapevine genetics and development in the Department of Plant Biology at Michigan State University where I was advised by Dr. Chad Niederhuth. In May 2024, I started a post-doc with Dr. Andrea Sweigart at the University of Georgia where I am currently studying the relationship between mating systems and epigenetic modifications in monkeyflowers.

My passion for biology started out of an adoration for the natural world and has led me down various routes - from my first project monitoring a bat population in high school to my PhD work studying grapevine genetics and development, as well as genome and epigenome evolution in angiosperms.
