  abstract  = "<b>Background:</b>
               <br>The unicellular charophycean green alga <i>Penium margaritaceum</i> has emerged as an appealing experimental organism in plant cell wall and cell biology research. Innovative practical approaches in the manipulation and maintenance of this unicellular model alga are needed in order to probe the complexities of its subcellular and molecular machinery. Protoplast isolation and manipulation expedites a new range of experimental possibilities for <i>Penium</i>-based studies. These include enhanced means of isolation of subcellular components and macromolecules, application of intracellular probes for high resolution microscopy of live cells, transformation studies and analysis of the fundamental mechanisms of plant cell expansion and wall polymer deposition.
               <br><b>Results:</b>
               <br>We present a methodology for enzyme-based digestion of the  <i>Penium</i> cell wall and the isolation of proto-plasts. The subcellular events associated with this technology are presented using multiple microscopy-based techniques. We also provide protocols for applying an array of intracellular dyes that can be used as markers for specific organelles and membrane microdomains in live cells. Finally, we present a protocol for the purification of a nuclei-rich  fraction from protoplasts, which can be used for the isolation of nuclear DNA.
               <br><b>Conclusions:</b>
               <br>Protoplast isolation, culturing and manipulation provide valuable means for molecular and cellular studies of <i>Penium</i>. The protocol described here offers a rapid and effective mechanism for fast and effective production of  protoplasts. Subsequently, the protoplasts may be used for microscopy-based studies of specific subcellular components and the isolation of organelles and nuclear DNA. These methods offer a new practical methodology for future  studies of this model organism in cell and molecular biology.",
